# IWRY

### IRC Client written in Python.

This was forked from *somewhere*, i don't remember where. Very simple to use, lightweight. To use this, you obviously need to have python installed. 

# Let's install IWRY

### Install Python and Git on Arch.

```sh
sudo pacman -S python python3-pip git
```

### Install Python and Git on Debian/Ubuntu.

```sh
sudo apt install python python3-pip git
```

### Install IWRY

```sh
git clone https://github.com/avunit/iwry
cd iwry
```

### How to use IWRY

```sh
./irwy.py <username> <channel>
```

`<username>` is your username which will be used by default. By running the comnmand again with a different username, your username will change. `<channel>`

### If there are any issues, i'll be sure to fix them asap.
